                <h3 style="color:#676669;">
           <br> Life at Children’s Learn and Play is all about learning through play and having fun in a warm, stimulating environment. We strive to provide a foundation for every child’s social, emotional, intellectual and physical well-being, where children are encouraged and applauded for their accomplishments.<br><br>

            Each child in our care is enriched and inspired through activities in math, science, language, literacy skills, and is led to interact socially in a respectful manner. It is our belief that the introduction to learning should be a joyful experience for every child.<br><br>

            We embrace the fact that every child is unique and different. Our teachers honor these differences by providing a balance of freedom of exploration and discovery, child-initiated choices, and through customized attention and activities, your child is encouraged and enabled to learn and grow at their own pace and in their own way. We allow children the time to be children, the opportunity to be responsible, to make their own choices and to be treated with respect.

                <h1>Our Goals</h1>
                <h3 style="color:#676669;">
                   <br> Our teaching methods will help your child develop and maintain a positive, healthy self-concept and encourage your child's growth to independence as he/she establishes himself/herself away from home. By partnering with families, together we will cultivate your child's growth socially and emotionally as he/she learns to interact with their peers.
